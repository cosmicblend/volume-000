## domains and focus
**07.06.2023**
Bought dotswf.ens and a handful of other domain extensions for dotswf. I like the nod to the software that first helped me see the browser as a medium.

Published artist lists will focus on what I see as exciting and emerging. Most projects I see focus on their collections. I'm operating minus investment, so what I buy isn't the sole signal of what I find fascinating.

Cutting the blogroll for now. The more I think about it, the more I don't like the idea of a blogroll.

A personal note. Navigating making things loneliness the last few days. Feeling like a joke. Don't have a robust professional network, so moments of doubt swing low, and moments of extreme confidence swing high


## rate limiting

thinking about refuses, rate limiting, and delicious. 


## a return to blogs as home and social outposts
**06.29.2023**

The primary focus for this project will always be artist discovery. I'm analyzing and cleaning data from my collecting wallets. Focused on the artists and the social graph signals that exist in that data, using it to help me discover other indie, not yet celebrated artists. The selfish focus will be on what I like regardless of style, chain, popularity, or critical acclaim.

Beyond that, I also want to prove a replicable open-source approach to setting up the infrastructure for indie media/publishing projects. This includes:
- thinking about what files in a volume I want pinned on my ipfs node
- exploring my working belief that indie media that wants to be decentralized/federated needs to host their own ipfs node. This extends to using those paths for media assets they might mint. 
- I don't buy into the aspirations of one dominant media protocol. I want to see many protocols and many modular frontends that you can self-host to create boutique experiences (plus a marketplace of sorting algos) each tailored to spotlighting, exploring, and synthesizing the "now" of these niche networks. 
- exploring what hosting "self" in a federated/decentralized way means for these networks.
- exploring how to set up self-hosted, opt-out default data-sharing experiences for online moments (drops, etc). the first test will be a video-leaning clubhouse tool that will exist on a subdomain. It will have basic social functions and paths for creators in the network to create revenue via a mix of public and access gated live experiences.

not the best summary of my thoughts but writing isn't my thing. trying to build a habit here.

## building parsers he screams
**06.28.2023**

feeling pretty exposed building it this way. also feels like a very literal example of "build in public". I want to play around with the type stack that's more fun parsers are boring.

a part of what this is is a challenge for me to try and get comfy being louder and saying more as everyone close to me says I need to do. I lean toward the quiet side, saying one thing always feels like i'm screaming.



## the first post. keeping it simple.
**06.25.2023**

to-do's
- What is this expanded
- Breakdown the experiments structure a bit
- Prove ipfs pipeline
- Release the unfiltered artist discovery frontend
- Release the calendar
- Prove federated pipeline
- Find a few interviewers and writers
- Find the first few collabs
- Explain the studio
- Explain the gallery
- Github pages with astro for blog, barebones. small, performant, only whats needed plus a little play
complete a 78 piece protoype that informs volume zeros' study. 12 month volumes (maybe less, not sure yet), many issues/collections/releases
