file structure, notes, and whatever else I add for experiment 000


## quick note
**07.12.2023**

made the decision that i'll only spotlight artists whose work i don't own at first. 


## art interest graph. extended
**07.06.2023**

left out that the majority of blog posts will have more of a del.icio.us bookmarking feel. i'm not a writing i'm more of an infovore


## art interest graph
**07.06.2023**

[How to Blow Up a Timeline](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2023/7/6/how-to-blow-up-a-timeline) by eugene wei really stood out yesterday. art graph is stuck in my mind now. 

prepping the first ten blog posts and selecting the first set of featured artists this weekend between Mathcastles class work. I highly recommend the mathcastles sessions, perfect mental floss, and the class work is also challenging. 

i don't think i'll select the artists each week in the future. instead i'll randomize the selection from the researched artist pool. going to have to put some constraints around pieces displayed per artist. I don't want it to be one from each, and i don't want it to be all from, say, two people. 

Still trying to decide on the feature display timeframe too. three days per feature might be better. 

i don't want to spotlight what i've collected, but i also think it might be wise to give a small "collected" signal on featured artists. my concern is that i don't want people to assume it's just a showcase of what i or a small group has bought. the larger idea isn't an art fund. my goal here is to keep the artists and their work the primary focus, it is not about what i have or haven't collected in my mind.


## first release artists and data things
**07.06.2023**

first release artists are all loaded and cross-referenced to collections in storyblok.

expanding on the artist's discovery. i've been querying transaction data to try and find commonality signals across artist wallets. i then use that data to help surface new artists that might interest me. this results in a list of new artists that i then spend time researching. 

its a promising experiment so far. it has given me a few long-term ideas. 

deciding what an artist's signal is and finding crossover connections has been tedious, but the collection process and hunches are improving. some parts of data collection and cleaning will be automated in time. for now, a more manual process makes sense.


## domains and focus
**07.06.2023**

Bought dotswf.ens and a handful of other domain extensions for dotswf. I like the nod to the software that first helped me see the browser as a medium.

Published artist lists will focus on what I see as exciting and emerging. Most projects I see focus on their collections. I'm operating minus investment, so what I buy isn't the sole signal of what I find fascinating.

Cutting the blogroll for now. The more I think about it, the more I don't like the idea of a blogroll.

A personal note. Navigating making things loneliness the last few days. Feeling like a joke. Don't have a robust professional network, so moments of doubt swing low, and moments of extreme confidence swing high


## rate limiting
**07.01.2023**

thinking about refuses, rate limiting, and delicious. 


## a return to blogs as home and social outposts
**06.29.2023**

The primary focus for this project will always be artist discovery. I'm analyzing and cleaning data from my collecting wallets. Focused on the artists and the social graph signals that exist in that data, using it to help me discover other indie, not yet celebrated artists. The selfish focus will be on what I like regardless of style, chain, popularity, or critical acclaim.

Beyond that, I also want to prove a replicable open-source approach to setting up the infrastructure for indie media/publishing projects. This includes:
- thinking about what files in a volume I want pinned on my ipfs node
- exploring my working belief that indie media that wants to be decentralized/federated needs to host their own ipfs node. This extends to using those paths for media assets they might mint. 
- I don't buy into the aspirations of one dominant media protocol. I want to see many protocols and many modular frontends that you can self-host to create boutique experiences (plus a marketplace of sorting algos) each tailored to spotlighting, exploring, and synthesizing the "now" of these niche networks. 
- exploring what hosting "self" in a federated/decentralized way means for these networks.
- exploring how to set up self-hosted, opt-out default data-sharing experiences for online moments (drops, etc). the first test will be a video-leaning clubhouse tool that will exist on a subdomain. It will have basic social functions and paths for creators in the network to create revenue via a mix of public and access gated live experiences.

not the best summary of my thoughts but writing isn't my thing. trying to build a habit here.

## building parsers he screams
**06.28.2023**

feeling pretty exposed building it this way. also feels like a very literal example of "build in public". I want to play around with the type stack that's more fun parsers are boring.

a part of what this is is a challenge for me to try and get comfy being louder and saying more as everyone close to me says I need to do. I lean toward the quiet side, saying one thing always feels like i'm screaming.



## the first post. keeping it simple.
**06.25.2023**

to-do's
- What is this expanded
- Breakdown the experiments structure a bit
- Prove ipfs pipeline
- Release the unfiltered artist discovery frontend
- Release the calendar
- Prove federated pipeline
- Find a few interviewers and writers
- Find the first few collabs
- Explain the studio
- Explain the gallery
- Github pages with astro for blog, barebones. small, performant, only whats needed plus a little play
complete a 78 piece protoype that informs volume zeros' study. 12 month volumes (maybe less, not sure yet), many issues/collections/releases
