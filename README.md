## Building parsers he screams
feeling pretty exposed building it this way. also feels like a very literal example of "build in public". I want to play around with the type stack that's more fun parsers are boring.

a part of what this is is a challenge for me to try and get comfy being louder and saying more as everyone close to me says I need to do. I lean toward the quiet side, saying one thing always feels like i'm screaming.
